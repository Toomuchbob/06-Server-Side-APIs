# 06-Server-Side-APIs

* This project accesses the Open Weather API and manipulates the returned object to create the current weather and forecasted weather

* Searching for a city is locally stored and shown in an aside which can be reselected for easy access

* When a city is selected, the current weather, and a 5 day forecast populates across div (and other) elements

* A second AJAX query is used to get the UV index from a different URL
